I'm Young-Chan, a bioinformatician and software developer based in South Korea.
My professional experiences have been centred around the field of genomics:
architecturing analysis pipelines and maintaining IT infrastructures.

I'm also very keen on teaching scientists, both prospective and current, on basic
programming concepts and best practices to enhance research capabilities.

Using theatre set as a metaphor, I found myself preferring to do work in the 
backstage, rather than in the spotlight. My tendencies have been towards 
pushing to do the hard, but necessary work that may not shine, but required 
to lay out a strong foundation to build something big and complex. This is also
reflected in how I teach, where I emphasise the importance of basic skills and 
concepts.
