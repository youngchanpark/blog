I'm currently taking a break to deal with personal issues and studying Algorithms & Data Structures to prepare for some technical interviews.
I'm also occasionally attending some bioinformatics group studies to mentor those interested in starting bioinformatics.

If you're interested in bioinformatics and programming but don't know how to get started, feel free to contact me.
